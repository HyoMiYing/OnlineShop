# test
Rok, 5.7.
Pisal bom v angleščini zaradi lažjega izražanja glede programerkih izrazov.

I have finished my first assignment. 

----Revision
I haven't spent much time on the visual aspect of the site, but I nevertheless used bootstrap.

If there is any thing that would need more of my attention any further would be the unittest and functional tests. 

Unittests all pass, but they do not test everything that should be tested.

Functional tests (they are the reason that 'Selenium' is in requirements.txt) do not pass. The problem is not in the web app, but in the tests themselves. I need more knowledge to write out tests beforehand writing the main code itself. I still left the file there. I will maybe need it in the assignments #2 and #3.
